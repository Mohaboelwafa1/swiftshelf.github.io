Hi, I’m Mohammed, an iOS developer passionate about Swift, and building clean, modern mobile apps.

I’ve been crafting iOS apps professionally for several years, focusing on writing maintainable, efficient code and exploring the latest Apple technologies.

On SwiftShelf, I share tutorials, tips, and insights about Swift development, Swift best practices, and practical app-building guides — all designed to help fellow iOS developers level up.
